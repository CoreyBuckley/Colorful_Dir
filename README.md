# Colorful Directory

#### **Disclamer: Use caution when enabling the color parameter. Colors can move fast and may trigger photosensitive epilipsy.**

This is a powershell command designed to output the results of a directory listing command (e.g. dir, ls, Get-ChildItem) in various colors.
This command is for fun and shouldn't be used for anything other than its intended purpose because the output is text, not objects.

## The Format of cdir

cdir [[-path] <String>] [[-color] <Boolean>]

All parameters are optional. By default, the path is the current working directory, and color is disabled in case anyone is seizure-prone.
